## Demo website for CAS Network 

Demo website including background to paper, and network to try yourself. 

### Paper summary 

In this paper we trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to reproduce the concentration (C) and asymmetry (A) measurements based on a single galaxy input images. We find that our trained machine learn method finds CAS values such that the average magnitude of error on the C and A values are 0.14 and 0.045 respectively,  both of which are lower than the average error on those measurements. This shows that the network can be used to measure these parameters to a similar level of confidence as previous algorithms.
Analysing these parameters for a large galaxy sample can provide an estimate of the merger fraction which can help to understand the transition from the peculiar/irregular galaxies at high redshift, to the well defined Hubble sequence we observe locally.
