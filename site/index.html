<h2>Concentration</h2>
<body>The Concentration (C) parameter is simply a measure of how concentrated the light from the central region of a galaxy is compared to the outer parts. This can tell us if a galaxy has a disk structure, is more elliptical, or is an irregular type galaxy. 
It is calculated using the ratio of two radii that contain a predefined amount of light from the galaxy. 
For our measurements we use the ratio of the radii containing 80% and 20% of the total light.

<h2>Asymmetry</h2>
<body>The Asymmetry (A) value is a measure of how asymmetric the galaxy light is, meaning galaxies that are undergoing a merging event with another galaxy will have high A values most of the time. The A value of a large sample of galaxies can then be used to estimate the merger fraction which is important in galaxy evolution models.
It is calculated by rotating the image 180Â° and subtracting it from the pre-rotated image. The residuals are then summed and divided by the original galaxy flux.  </body>
