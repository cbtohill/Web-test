<h2>Concentration</h2>
<body>The Concentration (C) parameter is simply a measure of how concentrated the light from the central region of a galaxy is compared to the outer parts. This can tell us if a galaxy has a disk structure, is more elliptical, or is an irregular type galaxy. 
It is calculated using the ratio of two radii that contain a predefined amount of light from the galaxy. 
For our measurements we use the ratio of the radii containing 80% and 20% of the total light.
